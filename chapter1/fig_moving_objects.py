SDSS Moving Object Data
-----------------------
Figure 1.8.

The orbital semimajor axis vs. the orbital inclination angle diagram for the
first 10,000 catalog entries from the SDSS Moving Object Catalog (after
applying several quality cuts). The gaps at approximately 2.5, 2.8, and 3.3 AU
are called the Kirkwood gaps and are due to orbital resonances with Jupiter.
The several distinct clumps are called asteroid families and represent remnants
from collisions of larger asteroids.
