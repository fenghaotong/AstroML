Example of classification
-------------------------
Figure 4.5.

An example of a simple classification problem between two Gaussian
distributions. Given a value of x, we need to assign that measurement to one
of the two distributions (background vs. source). The cut at xc = 120 leads
to very few Type II errors (i.e., false negatives: points from the distribution
hS with x < xc being classified as background), but this comes at the cost of
a significant number of Type I errors (i.e., false positives: points from the
distribution :math:`h_B` with x > xc being classified as sources).
